# AI-Enhanced E-Commerce App

This is a simple e-commerce frontend enhanced with an AI-powered smart search feature. The app allows users to search for products with natural language queries like "jewelry under $20" or "electronics above 300", and intelligently matches the intent using semantic similarity.


# 🤖 AI Feature Chosen
🔍 Smart Product Search (NLP): Option A

- Implemented a smart product search feature that:

- Understands fuzzy category names (e.g., "men" → "men's clothing")

- Detects price modifiers (e.g., "under 50", "no more than 100", "approximately 300")

- Supports natural language search with synonyms and typos

- Uses semantic similarity (Dice coefficient + string similarity) to match input

# 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- React – Frontend framework

- string-similarity – For fuzzy matching categories

- Custom Dice Coefficient – For word-level semantic comparison

- JavaScript Regex – For numeric and modifier parsing

- GitHub + GitHub Desktop – Version control
